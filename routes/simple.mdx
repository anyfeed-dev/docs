title: "Simple Route"
description: "The simple route is used for the majority of cases."

If your web feed is as simple as requesting a link and extracting some information, you should use the simple route.

The simple route is the most efficient way to generate a web feed. It doesn't require a whole JS runtime, but it does lack some features.

## Definition

You need to set `"type": "simple"` when defining your route, and then provide your `actions` .

```javascript
export default defineRoute({
    name: 'my-first-simple-route',
    type: 'simple',
    actions: [...],
})
```

Or you can use `defineSimpleRoute`:

```javascript
export default defineSimpleRoute({
    name: 'my-first-simple-route',
    actions: [...],
})
```

And if you like, you can also move your `actions` definition to a separate `actions.ts` file.

```javascript actions.ts
export default defineSimpleActions([...]);
```

<Note>
  We recommend providing your actions in TypeScript form to ensure you never make a typo or similar mistakes.

  The definition script for a simple route will only run in the deploy step. If you need to do something with JavaScript, you have to choose Script Route.

## Actions

`actions` is an array that provides a list of actions you want to perform.

For now, only the following actions are available:

- `get-html` Request a web page's content by URL, either statically or dynamically rendered.
- `get-json` Request JSON data from a URL.
- `extract-data-from-html` Extract data from a URL using a CSS query selector.

But we plan to make simple routes more and more useful. We expect at least 70% of routes in our official registry to be written in simple routes. So you can request any features you want as long as it can be described well in JSON, not a script, and we will make it for you.

When defining an `action` in your route file, you can use the JSON format. However, in most cases, you may want to use our helper functions created for each action.

```javascript
const actions = defineSimpleActions([
    {
        "action": "get-html",
        "params": {
            "url": "https://example.com",
			"render": "dynamic"
        }
    }
])

// OR

import { getHtml } from "@anyfeed/platform/simple"

const actions = defineSimpleActions([
    getHtml("https://example.com", {render: "dynamic"}),
])
```
